# Programmers

This repo works to archive Python solutions of the [Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/), which is a popular online platform that offers a collection of coding challenges and algorithmic problems for programmers in Korea🇰🇷

- I'm currently working on beginner level algorithms rated at level 0, and also tackling level 1 problem sets

### Completed problem log

- sum_of_integers [덧셈식 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/181947) is a script that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum, displaying the result as a string
- input_string_concatenation [문자열 붙여서 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/181946) is a script that takes two string inputs from the user, concatenates them together, and then prints the resulting concatenated string
- integer_to_reverse_list [자연수 뒤집어 배열로 만들기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12932) is a function that takes an integer n as input and converts it into a list of its individual digits in reverse order
- string_sort_reverse [문자열 내림차순으로 배치하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12917) is a function that takes a string s as input, converts it into a list of its characters, sorts the characters in reverse order, and then returns the sorted characters as a single string
- p_y_counts [문자열 내 p와 y의 개수](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12916) is a function that takes a string s as input and checks whether the number of occurrences of the letter 'p' (case-insensitive) is equal to the number of occurrences of the letter 'y' (case-insensitive). It returns True if the counts are equal and False otherwise
- even_odd_identifier [짝수와 홀수](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12937) is a function that takes an integer num as input and checks whether it is even or odd. It then returns the result as a string, stating whether the number is "Even" or "Odd"
- perfect_square_checker [정수 제곱근 판별](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12934) is a function that takes an integer n as input and performs a specific mathematical operation on it. It checks if n is a perfect square, and if it is, it returns the next perfect square number. If n is not a perfect square, it returns -1
- sum_of_range [두 정수 사이의 합](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12912) is a function that takes two integers a and b as input and calculates the sum of all integers between a and b (inclusive).
- gcd_lcm_calculator [최대공약수와 최소공배수](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12940) is a function that takes two integers n and m as input and performs a specific mathematical operation on them. The function finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and m and then returns a list containing the GCD and the least common multiple (LCM) of n and m
- department_funding_count [예산](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12982) is a function that takes two inputs: a list of integers d representing the budgets of different departments, and an integer budget representing the total budget available. The function calculates the number of departments that can be funded within the given budget.
